# Butter
This code serves as a reference for how I deployed my analytical deep learning model using Flask, FastAPI, and Docker.
In the app folder model.py showcases how the predicition pipleline was layed out and the main.py is where the endpoints interact.
saved_model.pb and the supporting files is one of the ways TensorFlow outputs saved models.
Updates for the front end will be coming soon... till then enjoy butter
